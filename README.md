# Upgrad Bike Sharing Assignment
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- This project aims to model the demand for shared bikes in the American market, helping BoomBikes understand key factors affecting demand to guide post-pandemic business strategy and optimize market positioning.
- The project aims to identify key factors influencing shared bike demand in the American market. By modeling these factors, management can adjust strategies to optimize operations, meet customer expectations, and use insights to predict demand in new markets.
- Bike Sharing dataset is being used


## Conclusions
- approximately 82% of the variance in data is explained by the model
- All the selected variables are significant as their p-value is 0.
- p(F-statistic) is very low, which means that the overall model fit is significant, and not by chance.
- The model generalizes well on both train and test data, as R2-score of both is approximately equal.
